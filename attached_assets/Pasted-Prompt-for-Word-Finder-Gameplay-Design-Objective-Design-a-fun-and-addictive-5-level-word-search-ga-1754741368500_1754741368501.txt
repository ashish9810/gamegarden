Prompt for Word Finder Gameplay Design

Objective:
Design a fun and addictive 5-level word search game with a smooth difficulty curve that keeps players engaged, challenged, and rewarded without frustrating them.

Core Gameplay:

A 12×12 letter grid is displayed in the center of the screen.

Players must find all words hidden in the grid by clicking & dragging (or tapping & dragging) across letters.

Words can be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and—at higher levels—backwards.

As difficulty increases, words become longer, less common, and more intertwined in the grid.

UI Layout for Best Experience:

Center: The main 12×12 grid, visually clean with clear letter spacing.

Right Side Panel: List of words to find. When a player finds a word, it gets:

Struck through in the list.

Highlighted in green in the grid.

Top Bar: Level number + progress bar (“Level X of 5”).

Bottom Bar: Timer, "Restart Level" button, and a “Words Found: X / Total” counter.

Difficulty Progression:

Level 1: Only horizontal & vertical words, common and short. Minimal overlap.

Level 2: Introduce simple diagonals. Words slightly longer.

Level 3: Backwards words allowed. More overlap between words.

Level 4: Mix of all directions, medium-to-long words, more clustering.

Level 5: Longest words, dense overlaps, all directions, less common vocabulary.

Player Feedback & Engagement:

Correct Selection: Green highlight in the grid + strike-through in word list + satisfying sound effect + small confetti animation.

Incorrect Selection: Brief red flash feedback.

Progress Feedback: “Words Found: X / Total” counter updating instantly.

Completion Flow:

Level Complete: Smooth animation with a celebratory sound.

Show stats: time taken, accuracy, and words found.

Offer “Next Level” or “Replay Level” buttons.

Final Completion (after Level 5): “Congratulations! You completed the challenge!” screen with total completion time and replay option.

Tone & Feel:

The game should feel approachable at first but evolve into a brain-teasing challenge.

The word lists should strike a balance between familiar and tricky to keep players in a “just one more level” mindset.

Visuals should be clean, responsive, and satisfying on both desktop and mobile.
