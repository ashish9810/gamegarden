Name, Place, Animal, Thing – Game Prompt
Objective / Description
"Name, Place, Animal, Thing" is a fast-paced, nostalgic word game where players must quickly think of and type a person's name, a place, an animal, and a thing — all starting with the same randomly chosen letter.
The game blends speed, memory recall, and vocabulary skills, creating a fun yet mentally stimulating experience for solo play or group competitions.
Only valid entries are rewarded — each answer is checked against a dictionary/database to ensure it’s a real, relevant word in the correct category. Random letters, gibberish, or unrelated terms result in 0 points for that slot.

1. Core Gameplay Experience
Game starts with a smooth, animated reveal of a random alphabet (large, centered, playful pop-in animation, subtle sound).

Players must type Name, Place, Animal, and Thing starting with that alphabet within a set timer (default 30s, adjustable to 15s or 45s).

Answer Validation:

Uses a verified word database for each category.

Names checked against a global/common name list (first names only).

Places checked against a cities, countries, regions database.

Animals checked against an animal species list.

Things checked against a general nouns list.

2. Scoring
10 points for each correct, valid answer.

Perfect Round Bonus: 40 points + 10-point bonus if all four are valid.

Invalid, irrelevant, or made-up words = 0 points for that slot.

Duplicate answers (same as previous rounds) = 0 points.

3. Difficulty & Challenge Design
Start with easy letters (A, B, C) and gradually introduce harder ones (Q, X, Z).

No repeats rule to force fresh thinking.
